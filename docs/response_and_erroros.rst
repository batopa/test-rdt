Response and Errors
===================

Response
~~~~~~~~

Usually the response of API query has the structure

.. code:: json

    {
        "api": "objects",
        "data": {},
        "method": "get",
        "params": [],
        "url": "http://example.com/api/v1/objects/1"
    }

where:

-  ``api`` is the endpoint called
-  ``data`` is an object containing all data requested
-  ``method`` is the HTTP verb used in the request
-  ``params`` contains all query url params used in the request
-  ``url`` is the complete url requested (full base url + basepath +
   endpoint + other)

To set ``data`` for response is available the method
``ApiBaseController::setData()`` that accepts an array as first
argument. A second argument permits to replace (default) or merge
present data with that passed.

Other meta data can be placed inside response object, for example
``paging`` useful to paginate results:

.. code:: json

    {
        "api": "objects",
        "data": {...},
        "method": "get",
        "paging": {
            "page": 1,
            "page_size": 10,
            "page_count": 10,
            "total": 995,
            "total_pages": 100
        },
        "params": [],
        "url": "http://example.com/api/v1/objects/1/children"
    }

where:

-  ``page`` is the current page
-  ``page_size`` is the page dimension
-  ``page_count`` is the number of items inside current page
-  ``total`` if the count of all items
-  ``total_pages`` is the total pages available

.. note::

   If you need **to serve empty response body** to client you can use
   ``ApiBaseController::emptyResponse()`` that by default send a *204 No
   Content* status code. Pass another status code as first argument to send
   different status code.

Errors
~~~~~~

Every time the API thrown an error the response will be similar to

.. code:: json

    {
        "error": {
            "status": 405,
            "code": null,
            "message": "Method Not Allowed",
            "details": "Method Not Allowed",
            "more_info": null,
            "url": "http://example.com/api/v1/foobar"
        }
    }

where:

-  ``status`` is the HTTP status code
-  ``code`` is the API error code (not implemented)
-  ``message`` is the error message
-  ``details`` is the error detail
-  ``more_info`` is the url to error documentation (not implemented)
-  ``url`` is the url that has responded with the error
